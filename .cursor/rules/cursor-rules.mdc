# Cursor Rules Location

How to add new cursor rules to the project

## Available Cursor Rules

- **`project-structure.mdc`**: Complete directory structure and file organization
- **`tech-stack.mdc`**: Technology stack, dependency versions, and best practices
- **`docker-setup.mdc`**: Complete guide for Docker setup, deployment, and configuration
- **`self-improvement.mdc`**: Guidelines for improving cursor rules

## Auto-Update Project Structure

The `project-structure.mdc` file is automatically kept up-to-date with the current project structure.

### To Update Project Structure Documentation

**Option 1: Run the npm script (Recommended)**
```bash
npm run update:project-structure
```

**Option 2: Run the script directly**
```bash
node .cursor/scripts/update-project-structure.js
```

**When to update:**
- After adding new modules, components, or directories
- After restructuring the project
- After adding new configuration files
- Before committing major changes
- When you reference `@cursor-rules.mdc` and want to ensure structure is current

The script will:
- Scan the entire project structure
- Update `.cursor/rules/project-structure.mdc` with current files and folders
- Preserve custom sections (Important Files Reference, Architecture Patterns, etc.)
- Maintain the frontmatter and formatting

**Note:** The script automatically ignores:
- `node_modules/`
- `.git/`
- `dist/`, `build/`
- Log files and temporary files
- Lock files (`package-lock.json`, `yarn.lock`)

How to add new cursor rules to the project

1. Always place rule files in PROJECT_ROOT/.cursor/rules/:
    ```
    .cursor/rules/
    ├── your-rule-name.mdc
    ├── another-rule.mdc
    └── ...
    ```

2. Follow the naming convention:
    - Use kebab-case for filenames
    - Always use .mdc extension
    - Make names descriptive of the rule's purpose

3. Directory structure:
    ```
    PROJECT_ROOT/
    ├── .cursor/
    │   └── rules/
    │       ├── your-rule-name.mdc
    │       └── ...
    └── ...
    ```

4. Never place rule files:
    - In the project root
    - In subdirectories outside .cursor/rules
    - In any other location

5. Cursor rules have the following structure:

```
---
description: Short description of the rule's purpose
globs: optional/path/pattern/**/*
alwaysApply: false
---
# Rule Title

Main content explaining the rule with markdown formatting.

1. Step-by-step instructions
2. Code examples
3. Guidelines

Example:

```typescript
// Good example
function goodExample() {
  // Implementation following guidelines
}

// Bad example
function badExample() {
  // Implementation not following guidelines
}
```
